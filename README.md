## Hi, I'm Richard Nguyen

* I enjoy writing (useful) applications in Python and JavaScript. I'm also familiar with writing in C-like languages!
* You can check out some interactive JavaScript apps I wrote on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/pens/showcase).
* Iâ€™m learning TypeScript and React at the moment to build [Incremental Quest](https://github.com/Captain-Chen/incremental-quest).
* I am currently relearning how to write programs in C and scripts with Bash in a Linux system.
* I'm looking for a role in system administration in a Linux environment or backend web development using Python or Node.js.
