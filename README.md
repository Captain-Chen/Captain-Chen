## Hi, I'm Richard Nguyen

* I enjoy writing (useful) applications in Python and JavaScript. I'm also familiar with writing in C-like languages!
* You can check out some interactive JavaScript apps I wrote on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/pens/showcase).
* I've recently started working with the Django framework to build a fansite.
* I'm currently looking for a role in IT or backend web development using Python or Node.js.
