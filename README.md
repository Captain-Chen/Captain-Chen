## Hi, I'm Richard Nguyen

* I enjoy writing (useful) applications in Python and JavaScript. I'm also familiar with writing in C-like languages!
* You can check out some interactive JavaScript apps I wrote on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/pens/showcase).
* I am currently studying and preparing for the CompTIA exams.
* I am looking for a role in IT, preferably in a Linux environment or backend web development using Python or Node.js.
