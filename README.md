## Hi, I'm Richard Nguyen

* I enjoy writing (useful) applications in Python and JavaScript. I'm also familiar with writing in C-like languages!
* You can check out some interactive JavaScript apps I wrote on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/pens/showcase).
* I've recently picked up Django and Golang.
* I'm looking for a development role that uses Python, Node.js or Golang.
